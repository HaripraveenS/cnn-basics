Learnt how to write the dataloader, the model and the training code . The following analysis was done:
- With Batch Norm
- Adding new layers
- With Dropout
- Different activation functions at the end
- Different pooling strategies
- Different optimizers
- Basic Augmentation like Rotation, Translation, Color Change


Also experimented with:
Experiment with
- Residual Blocks
- Different learning strategies
